# 🎮 Word Drop

**Word Drop** is a fast-paced reflex and typing game built using `graphics.h` in C++. Words fall from the top of the screen, and your goal is to type them before they hit the bottom. If you miss, you lose health — but if you succeed, you score points and recover health. The longer you survive, the faster the words fall!
